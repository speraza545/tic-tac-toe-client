#Tic Tac Toe Game
This application lets a players test their skills in a battle of wits,
and intelligence, known as tic tac toe.

##Technologies Used:
 HTML, CSS, Boostrap, Jquery, and Javascript.

##Planning Story
When I approached this project, I started off with a wireframe, and a general
concept of how I wanted the game to operate. The tough part was just mixing
my ideas with the computers language. A lot of my code edits, and fixes
came about when I was out on a drive, or in a store doing daily tasks. Sometimes
taking a break from the computer was the best thing I could do to invoke
inspiration.

Despite this, I also spent quite a bit of time just throwing in random code
I made up, hoping to see the effect I was looking for. More often than not,
it wasn't. Various web articles were also helpful.

However the whole trial, and error, process did help me understand
how to communicate with the computer better. More importantly, IT WORKED!

###User Stories
As a user, I want the ability to start a new game so I can keep the fun going

As a user, I want a simple, easy to understand design so I dont get lost
just trying to work the program

As a user, I want to be able to see who won and lost the game so I can gloat
if I win.

As a user, I want to see how many games I play, so I can really consider
how much time Im spending on this app for my skills to improve.

###Unsolved Problems
I would like to eventually install a timer for the turns, so each person
only has 3 seconds to make a move. I think this would make the game more exciting
and add more variety to it.
